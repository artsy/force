The channel nav is currently used in two places: team channel landing pages, and team channel article pages.

## `options`
`@$waypointEl`: The waypoint element that controls when the sticky nav should become fixed
`@offset`: The number of pixels the waypoint should offset from the given waypoint element
`@$content`: The element that shifts down when the link nav is open, ie: `#article-content`
