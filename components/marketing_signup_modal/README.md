# Marketing Signup Modal

A modal that pops up after 3 seconds when a logged out user from outside Artsy lands on the containing page.

## Usage

This uses config variables to determine where it's applied. Use `heroku config:set` to configure a campaign. e.g. Set `MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_SLUG=miami` to allow the query param ?m-id=miami to be added to any page for a modal to appear.

Examples:

````
MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_SLUG=miami
MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_COPY=Sign up for early access
MARKETING_SIGNUP_MODAL_IMG=http://placekitten.com/200/200
````

If this expirment results in a worthwhile amount of collector acquistion then eventually the idea is we will replace this config data with a tool we give Marketing to manage themselves.

## Implementation

This is implemented globally in our main_layout and fair_layout component by adding the view client-side and checking against the config variables added to sharify.
