    "press_release": "MONET IS MY CHURCH\r\nIVAN COMAS / TRAVIS LYCAR /\r\nHENNING STRASSBURGER / TYRA TINGLEFF\r\nOPENING: THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 6–8 PM\r\nEXHIBITION: MARCH 17–APRIL 13, 2017\r\n\r\nLars Dittrich and André Schlechtriem are pleased to present\r\nMonet Is My Church, a group show featuring Ivan\r\nComas, Travis Lycar, Henning Strassburger, and Tyra\r\nTingleff, opening March 16 and running though April 13,\r\n2017. Reflecting on the current state of abstraction in\r\ncontemporary practices, each of the four artists premieres\r\nnew large-scale paintings conceived specifically for the\r\nfour walls of the gallery. Monet Is My Church, a text pulled\r\nfrom a comment in an Instagram post picturing a woman\r\nstanding in front Claude Monet’s Water Lilies at the Musée\r\nde l’Orangerie in Paris, considers the exalted space and\r\noften spiritual architecture around abstraction in light of\r\nthe prevailing temporary and immaterial digital space of\r\nmobile screens. In the high and deep, subterranean, gallery\r\nspace at Linienstraße 23, the paintings invite the viewer\r\nto now re-indulge in the reverence for the observable\r\nphenomenon of the medium and movement.\r\nThe landscape-format abstract paintings of Ivan Comas\r\n(b. Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1987) combine conventional\r\npainting techniques with the parallel process of digital\r\nprinting. The oft-considered sacred space of painting\r\nis now fused with a synthetic intervention of technology.\r\nComas manipulates an industrial printer to fix pictorial effects\r\nover a layered, water-paint base. Those marks relate\r\nto gesture and expression, implying representation as if\r\nthe shapes on it were about to implode. The fetishized\r\nsystems of painting and technology merge, creating the\r\nrequired altered state of perception to enlighten and exercise\r\ncontemplation.\r\nTravis Lycar (b. Gimli, Canada, 1980) presents twin paintings,\r\nscaled up to 300 x 280 cm each. Through the artist’s\r\nown reduplication of scale, mark, color, and process,\r\nthe two works are inherently related and inevitably dissimilar.\r\nEmploying a restrained palette and a slightly withdrawn\r\napplication, Lycar questions what a painting could be\r\nwhen manifested out of a less technically influenced creative\r\nprocess, devoid of reference material and relying on\r\naesthetic impulses that might lie dormant, like a recessive\r\ngene. Engaging the tone of abstraction as a pseudo-religion\r\nwith a system of questions, doubt, and emotions to\r\nbe understood then accomplished through a meditative\r\npractice.\r\nAn induced state of reading is further challenged by the\r\nimposition of the more digital palette and quick commercial-\r\nready print surfaces of Henning Strassburger (b. Meißen,\r\nGermany, 1983). Bypassing the emotional or gestural\r\nmethods of painting, Strassburger incorporates short\r\nfree-form mark making with the nearly remarkable and\r\nseemingly graphical. Slight notions of text, icons, virtual\r\nspaces, and familiar realities sit on the surface of thinly\r\ncoated canvas.\r\nTyra Tingleff (b. Oslo, Norway, 1984) presents a pair of\r\npaintings that employ set strategies of abstraction, but at\r\nthe same time convey an impression of an uncertain reality,\r\na reality often mediated through the individual lens\r\nof the viewer and having various interpretations based\r\non personal past experiences. In Monet Is My Church,\r\nTingleff’s well-worked-over canvases can be perceived\r\nas either silent or noisy, or simultaneously confusing, not\r\nunlike an echo chamber or cave. The contending context\r\nconceals strict interpretations, allowing for distraction and\r\ntension. This space, where language is abstracted and\r\nabsent, ultimately allows for a potentially more mystical\r\npath to meaning and understanding.\r\nA full exhibition publication in English and German with\r\nan essay by Robert Grunenberg will be released in conjunction\r\nwith this exhibition. Please contact Owen Clements,\r\nowen(at)dittrich-schlechtriem.com, for information,\r\nimages and with any further inquiries.",

For him there are no more maps, nor orienteers, neither rights nor wrongs. All that remains is an occasional glimpse of something beautiful and familiar: a translucent memory of what was once meaningful, glowing through coldness of the void, far in the unreachable distance.’\r\n\r\nAs a part of Blue. Seventeen exhibition Olga Grotova will stage a live performance in the gallery. The artist questions the idea of continuity by juxtaposing fluid movements of the ballet dancers in space with the rigid notion of fragmented cinematographic time. Grotova invites chance into the event and at the same time denies its occurrence within the tightly controlled choreographed scenario.",

    "press_release": "Blue.Seventeen is a post-apocalyptic landscape that exists in the world “without us”: on the planet where we still exist as a species, leave traces — however, in this very moment we’ve stepped back, and from the active agents turned into spectators, detached from the action itself. Imagine the flight mode in a computer game, when one’s role of a player is replaced by the position of a scenery watcher: the one who got stuck in the moment, when the so-called present has not yet fallen into the past in order to free the space for some upcoming future. Here the linear passage of time is replaced by the relationship of co-composition amongst things and events, which are intentionally deprived of duration — the parameter that is inherently human-specific, as it is imposed by human determinism. Here the processes of production and consumption once reached its critical speed; and then “everything was so slow that even death became impossible, because dying itself was extended over such a long periods that it has become unbearable and no one wanted to die anymore.” (Neelova, 2016) \r\nThe works by artists Olga Grotova, Nika Neelova and Yelena Popova explore the materiality of this speculative space and experiment with the possibilities of art production and consumption within it. The time-based works by Olga Grotova deconstruct the linear vision of history — by exposing the artifice of the very idea of time as continuum. Her paintings, created by a means of screen-printing and digital post-production, reveal the transformation of a real artistic gesture into a fictional one. In so doing they question the notion of memory of the past, and seek the possibility of memory of the future. Reflecting the utopian envision of art production as anti-production, the paintings and ceramics by Yelena Popova are made from the materials that are “borrowed” from our planet, recycled, and used again: ashes, soil and organic colour pigments. Presented as a part of one exposition, the works exist as one living organism, spreading and occupying the room. Finally, the sculptural works by Neelova act as the ready-mades of this world without us. In graceful silence they are expecting the spectator of the future — the one who is distanced from the present moment for the minimal amount of time, required to deny the comforting reality produced by the framework of human’s eye and life-span. \r\n— by Sasha Burkhanova, 2017.",

    "description": "Existing at the intersection of sculpture, painting, assemblage, and installation, “Microcosm” unfolds as a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces. We enter the gallery-site into a sphere of different environments.",
    "press_release": "\r\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrocosm\r\nGeorge Carr\r\nSam Davis\r\nKyle Goldbach\r\nMaia Ruth Lee\r\nKate Spencer Stewart\r\nCameron Welch\r\n\r\nMarch 11 – April 15, 2017\r\nOpening Reception: Saturday, March 11th, 6-8pm \r\n\r\n\r\nMicrocosm (n.) c.1200, mycrocossmos (modern form from early 15c.), \"human nature, man viewed as the epitome of creation,\" literally \"miniature world,\" from Middle French microcosme and in earliest use directly from Medieval Latin microcosmus, from Greek mikros \"small\" (see mica) + kosmos \"world\" (see cosmos). General sense of \"a community constituting a world unto itself\" is attested from 1560s. Related: Microcosmic. A native expression in the same sense was petty world (c. 1600).\r\n\r\nExisting at the intersection of sculpture, painting, assemblage, and installation, “Microcosm” unfolds as a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces. We enter the gallery-site into a sphere of different environments, occupied by works of varying contributions of scale, medium, and intention. These varied intricacies invite us to delve into the intersections and respective mirroring between the microcosm and the macrocosm - the junctures between scared and forbidden spaces, utopias and heterotopias, the mythic and the real. \r\n\r\nWhile the works on view expose this ecosystem, it also creates a familiar tableau. The casual pleasures taken in visual and tactile exoticism, as seen in Kyle Goldbach’s architectural weavings or Cameron Welch’s assemblages of found imagery bound under paint. The source material used by both –large-scale billboard advertisements by Goldbach and personal photographs by Welch- speaks to the political implications of the printed image, once or twice removed from its source. In the organized haziness of Kate Stewart’s lush washes of colors, figure and ground are one, and the space of the picture spreads out beyond the canvas’s physical edges. Maia Ruth Lee’s paintings and free standing sculpture replicating traditional ornamental fences, paired with Sam Davis’ large replicas of everyday objects, address the forces constructing and demarcating spaces of access and site, while George Carr’s innovative and sophisticated approach to capturing the fragmented nature of form further dwells on the multiplicities of power structures. \r\n\r\nDifferences give way to shared sameness: each piece exists as both a structure, or encased universe, and a narrative tool that engages with a realm beyond its materiality; either heaven in a grain of sand, or the farthest shores of what may be.  \r\n\r\nFor additional information, please contact Camille Weiner: 323.549.0223 and camille@robertsandtilton.com Gallery hours are Tuesday – Saturday, 11:00am – 6:00pm.   \r\nRoberts & Tilton is located between Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard.   \r\nParking is available on the street and at Dunn Edwards located 1/2 block east of the gallery.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Carr investigates the ways in which power, desire, form, and meaning simultaneously manufacture and support one another. The surface of his paintings – sanded smooth and buffed in wax– lends a vector-graphic quality to his applied topographic marks, reminiscent of fossils. Extending this process to sculpture, Carr incorporates additional extensive graphic techniques through a digital image transfer process that embeds the images into the sanded resin surface. He received his MFA from the Yale School of Art. \r\n\r\n\r\nSam Davis’s practice investigates limit systems and the delineatory architecture of meaning as it might occur in vernacular media. In depicting subjects sensing differences and solving problems, interacting with other agencies in time and space and history, vernacular media becomes a productive lens to view these relationships in action. Public objects and texts, their furniture and architecture, end up describing the edges of available human experience, whether through proximity, boundary, weight, or surface; human experience defined by the size of the symbols available. He graduated with an MFA from the Yale School of Art in 2016. Recent exhibitions include Bureau Inc. and Topless, New York, Human Resources and Del Vaz Projects Los Angeles, and Species in Atlanta. His writing has appeared in C Magazine and on Rhizome.org\r\n\r\n\r\nKyle Goldbach’s multidisciplinary practice explores cultural ecology as it relates to materialism and alienation, while promoting a reevaluation of labor and resilience. Scavenging the commercial landscape for advertising product detritus, Goldbach reconfigures found materials to form layered assemblages, offering a pointed commentary at the omnipresence of consumer culture. He received a BFA from Tyler School of Art in 2012 and his MFA from the Yale School of Art. Recent group exhibitions include the Marginal Utility, Temple Contemporary, and Green Gallery at Yale School of Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaia Ruth Lee is a mixed media artist whose work is largely focused on her upbringing, coalescing references to traditional Nepali and Buddhist art styles with symbols and signs found in Western Culture and esoteric schools of thought. Recent paintings and sculptural pieces explore the implicit structures within labor, through both socio-economic and more abstracted cultural boundaries, through a selected lexicon of glyphs, alphabets, and language-as-text. Maia Ruth Lee was born in Busan, Korea and was raised in Kathmandu Nepal. Lee returned to Seoul for her Under- graduate studies in Fine Arts and after stints of studying in Canada and Italy she moved to the U.S. in 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nKate Spencer Stewart makes non-representational paintings through negotiating constants and variables. The paintings Nary, Very and Wary are three parts of a larger series meditating on color relationships, proposing hypnotic and prolonged looking through spatial disorientation. Stewart studied at the Mountain School of the Arts, Otis College of Art and Design, and received her MFA from UCLA. \r\n\r\n\r\nCameron Welch produces work invested in visual information, and how this informs the interior structures of image culture within materiality. His large-scale works utilize a varied set of assembled materials and processes, including collage, sewing, dying, staining, printing, flocking, stuffing, and painting. The reference images utilized refer to Welch’s personal history as a means to navigate identity, but the manner in which they manifest is through the language of formal abstraction. He received his MFA from Columbia University School of the Arts. \r\n\r\n",

    "description": "For her solo exhibition of multimedia works on paper, Hawaiian-born artist Tasya van Ree explores the relationship between alchemy, eros and the infinite mystery of the natural world.",
    "press_release": "Eric Buterbaugh Gallery\r\npresents\r\nTasya van Ree: Drawn from Nature March 16– May 14, 2017\r\nOpening reception: Thursday, March 16, 2017. 6-9PM\r\nEric Buterbaugh Gallery, 8271 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90048\r\nFor her solo exhibition of multimedia works on paper, Hawaiian-born artist Tasya van Ree explores the relationship between alchemy, eros and the infinite mystery of the natural world.\r\n \r\nLos Angeles, CA – The origins for Drawn from Nature were born of unconventional means: “I ran out of paper” explains artist Tasya van Ree, who begin to tear pages from botanical illustrator Joseph Prestele’s 1984 volume of lithographs as the base for her evocative drawings. Van Ree’s process of deletion and embellishment in black ink soon gave way to more detailed compositions using oil pastel, gridded lines, and her signature visual vocabulary of horses, hands and flowers. Flouting the process of taxonomy central to Prestele’s project of classifying the natural world, van Ree’s series instead highlights the elegant and erotic form of fruits and flora, relishing in the mystery of nature’s offerings.\r\nAt Eric Buterbaugh Gallery, van Ree will present a suite of her Drawn from Nature series alongside a selection of new multimedia works on paper. This new body of work was drafted intuitively and decisively, tending towards the calligraphic. Dream-like figures and symbols appear to exist in overlapping fields within the storehouse of the unconscious, unrestrained by horizon lines, vanishing points, or conventional scale and perspective. For van Ree, these images illustrate the futility of systematizing the world around us. “Everything is an illusion,” writes the artist, “reality is perception.”\r\nFormally, the body of work is a departure for the artist, who is perhaps best known for her striking and seductive black and white photographs of women. Recently van Ree has turned away from her lovers as muses, turning instead towards the natural world. “At this point in my life I’m less interested in examining and unpacking the human psyche,” van Ree explains. “Man tries to create boundaries and compartmentalize the unknown; this series reflects my radical embrace of nature in all its infinite mystery.”\r\nWhether through seductive, cinematic photographs of blonde bombshells, or in a poetic ink line framing a rare wildflower, Tasya van Ree has maintained a line of inquiry around the visual codes associated with the feminine. In 2015, she designed a cowboy hat for Stetson with a dramatic raised crown and oversized brim, guiding the historical signifier of western masculinity into the realm of the theatrical. More recently, her collaboration with fellow photographer Nitsa Citrine embraces the qualities and contradictions associated with womanhood, celebrating her subjects and their roles as activists, artists and healers—often simultaneously.\r\n  Images: Tasya van Ree, Tradescant’s Black Heart Cherry, 2016, ink on found illustrated paper, 8.5” x 12”; Tasya van Ree, A Bouquet of Flowers, 2016, graphite and oil pastel on rag paper, 16” x 20”; Tasya van Ree, Inheritance, 2016, mixed media on rag paper, 15” x 20”. All images courtesy the artist.\r\nTasya van Ree is a Los Angeles based artist and designer. Her evocative work speaks to the subtleties of human experience and its transitory nature. Solo exhibitions include Replica at Stephen Webster Beverly Hills, A State of Mind & The Affairs of Its Games at Chateau Marmont, L.A Spleen at Jules & Jim in Paris and a self-titled exhibition at Edgar Varela Fine Arts in New York. The artist has participated in group exhibitions alongside Amy Arbus, David Lynch, and Gus van Sant.\r\nAbout Eric Buterbaugh Gallery\r\nEric Buterbaugh established his namesake gallery in 2015 as the only project space in Los Angeles committed to showcasing artists who embrace the floral in their practice and work in the medium of scent. The flagship EB Florals perfumery, also on site, lends a base note of feminine elegance and luxury, which the gallery’s exhibiting artists are invited to disrupt, remark upon, or bring into sharper relief.\r\nGallery hours: Monday – Saturday, 11am–6pm Sunday, 12-5pm\r\nNow on view\r\nThrough March 11, 2017 Tallulah Willis: Please be gentle\r\n Media Contact\r\nKristen Berry\r\nHL Group for Eric Buterbaugh Gallery kberry@hlgrp.com 323.966.4606\r\nFor Eric Buterbaugh Gallery\r\nMaddie Phinney maddie@ebflorals.com 323.651.9844",

The \r\nNew German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent  “SEAT” series of large format color abstract",
    "press_release": "For Immediate Release: STEFAN HEYNE: SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction\r\nFebruary 25 – April 15, 2017, Gallery Hours: Tuesday – Saturday, 10:00 am – 6:00 pm, Opening: Saturday, February 25th from 6:00 – 8:00 pm\r\n\r\nDiane Rosenstein is pleased to announce SUPER VISION, the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent  “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions.  SUPER VISION opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. \r\n\r\nSince the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth.   Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational.  He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”.  In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions.  The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. \r\n\r\nIn his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space.  His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’.\r\n \r\nIn her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.”  \r\n\r\nStefan Heyne: SUPER VISION will be on view from February 25 – April 15, 2017\r\nThe artist will attend the opening reception on Saturday, February 25th 6p – 8p\r\n\r\nStefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany:  NAKED LIGHT: Die Belichtung des Unendlichen (Exposing Infinity), Stadische Galerie Dresden (2014), Speak to Me: Fotografien, Kunstmuseum Dieselkraftwerk Cottbus (2012); Die Magie der Leere: Fotografien 2006-2012 (The Magic of Emptiness), Kunstsammlungen und Museen Augsburg (2012); and Gegendarstellung, Stadtmuseum Gross-Gerau (2010).  He was included in The Autonomous Picture: Five Concepts of Contemporary Photography (Das autonome Bild: Fünf Konzepte aktueller Fotografie, Kunstmuseum Bochum (2016) and Light Painted Abstractions, Kaune Contemporary, Cologne (2016).  His photographs are in the permanent collections of DKW (Kunstmuseum Dieselkraftwerk Cottbus), Cottbus; and Kunstsammlungen und Museen Augsburg, both in Germany.  The artist lives and works in Berlin.\r\n\r\nPress inquiries: press@dianerosenstein.com\r\nSales inquiries: denis@dianerosenstein.com\r\n",

    "description": "Lawrence Fine Art will survey the work of New York School painter Aristodimos Kaldis.",
    "press_release": "Lawrence Fine Art is pleased to present \"Aristodimos Kaldis: Falstaff Revisited\" which will open on March 15 and extend for one month. The exhibition will also available to view on Artsy.\r\n\r\n\"The story of the post-WWII New York School artists is still being written,\" said Gallery Director Howard Shapiro.  \"Kaldis is one artist who deserves a reappraisal.\"\r\n\r\nKaldis was possessed of an outsize personality: \"He was large, noisy, histrionic, outrageous and irrepressible. His hair was long and unruly, his highly animated face seemed to sport many more features than could be entirely accounted for by nature-his very large nose was especially memorable-and in every weather he was wrapped in a bright red scarf of Isadora length that instantly set him apart from ordinary mortals,\" wrote Hilton Kramer in one review.\r\n\r\nYet it was his paintings which did and should command attention.  Continues Kramer: \"It was often a shock for people to discover that the man’s paintings were beautifully executed landscapes in a lyric mode. One hardly expected such a commanding pastoral style, all delicacy and nuance and romance, from the Falstaffian character that had been met on the street or at some art-world event. Where the public Kaldis seemed all but consumed in rhetoric and bluster, the painter had all the while been engaged in a highly poetic pursuit.\"\r\n\r\nKaldis was born in what is now Greece and came to this country at 17, around 1920, but was a late starter and did not begin painting until the late 1930s. Apparently, he was recognized quickly as a talent. When the Poindexter Gallery in New York organized an exhibition called The Thirties in 1956, Kaldis was included in the company of Stuart Davis, John Graham, Willem de Kooning, Ad Reinhardt and Mark Rothko.\r\n\r\nHe painted a number of wonderful modernist pieces, but he is especially known for his Greek landscapes--lyrical, abstracted, pastoral imaginings of a remembered past.  In this, he was most like Chagall and his renderings of his native Vitebsk. \r\n\r\nThe gallery will show a selection of early modernist works and a selection of his landscapes.  \"The standout in the show is Panhellenic Landscape from 1951,\" said Shapiro. \"It is turbulent, soulful, with hints of Kandinsky and Cezanne. Kramer called this work 'one of the best American paintings of its period.'\"\r\n\r\n",
