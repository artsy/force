Now in its 12th year, the fair welcomes 159 galleries into the halls of Oscar Niemeyer’s iconic Pavilhão Ciccillo Matarazzo. The fair has grown considerably in its number of international exhibitors, which is up to 44 this year, spanning galleries from Europe, Central and South America, the U.S., and Japan. The audience of fairgoers, which is 95% Brazilian, has also grown (from 6,000 in 2009 to 27,000 in 2016).</p><p>Exhibitors to a great degree catered to that audience, presenting choice works by historic and contemporary Brazilian artists, from modernist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/alfredo-volpi\">Alfredo Volpi</a>, to the recently deceased <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/tunga\">Tunga</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/vik-muniz\">Vik Muniz</a>. The fair also represented the strong design history in the country, with 25 Brazilian design galleries exhibiting. More broadly, it placed greater emphasis on modern artists and the trajectory of contemporary art—a new curated sector, Repertório, is devoted to artists who have made integral contributions to contemporary art. Also notable this year is a curated exhibition of Japanese artists, in honor of the city’s new cultural center, the Japan House, which opens next month.</p><p>Ahead of the fair, SP-Arte director Fernanda Feitosa addressed the weight of the current economic crisis in Brazil. She said that while there is no good time for an art fair now, “we cannot live by expecting a good time or a better time.” In times of crisis, she said, galleries must tighten their business practices and tap into creativity in order to strengthen their programs. </p><p>“The art market is not immune to the ups and down of the economy, not in Brazil, not anywhere else,” Feitosa said, “but we have a different strength, we’re moved by passion, we are moved by a piece you really want to buy and these passions are not limited by prices.” This not to say that SP-Arte has been unaffected by the crisis. While the fair witnessed a decline in sales between the 2015 and 2016 editions, the director remains optimistic. “These are cycles, you have to be prepared.” </p><p>While blue-chip international galleries and Brazilian galleries primarily brought their most prominent and sought-after artists, there was a strong range in terms of medium. “The artistic language in Brazil is very broad,” Feitosa said, pointing to the country’s strong art-historical traditions in painting, photography, sculpture, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/minimalism\">Minimalism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/concrete-art\">concrete art</a>, and abstraction. Exhibitors, attuned to this history, focused on these more traditional mediums rather than digital and video works.</p><p>While the fair was flush with mid-career and established Brazilian artists, there were still discoveries to be made. Below we share 15 artists who are producing innovative and thoughtful work, from Brazil and beyond.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

She then photographed the shelters with their creators, resulting in a series of somewhat dark though intriguing images of people confined (some appear trapped) within these structures. Drawing upon the childlike affinity for building forts, she chose to do this with adults, questioning how the act would change. As the photographs evidence, with adults, these makeshift structures become portraits of their creators—some sturdy and others precarious, some minimal and others elaborate—that reflect survival instincts and the basic need for shelter among impoverished peoples. Presented in brightly colored frames that might be found in a child’s room, and titled “Frantic,” the works are meant to surface the sensation of building these structures, from the excitement of a child to the anxieties of an adult. Piotrowska is currently continuing the project, now working with people living in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

Tapping into the strong Japanese culture present in the city, his works are, as the gallery’s Magê Abàtayguara describes, “in dialogue with traditional ways of creating vases and masks.”</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

The São Paulo-based artisan and weaver is a current student at Faculdade Paulista de Artes, and for this project, he researched the various regions of São Paulo where he has traveled. He spoke with people and culled together objects, ultimately choosing 33 regions to create a long woven panel to represent each one. Heberte uses brightly colored yarns as well as plastic, synthetic textiles—he even weaves objects, like watches, into his works. Drawn to weaving for its use throughout disparate time periods, he highlights its historic traditions and the medium’s ability to connect various groups of people. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

Ahead of this fate, she rented various types of animals and set them loose in rooms of the house, then photographed the bizarre scenes and painted them.

He focuses on the manufacturing cycle of phones, highlighting the disconnect between the desire to innovate and the wasted materials that come with that innovation. The new series at the fair, “Último sussurro” (“Last whisper”), includes a pile of hundreds of old phones and discarded malfunctioning parts; some flicker with videos, representing the short lifespan of a cell phone. In past works he’s captured the exploitative labor practices in the Congo that occur in order to mine the minerals needed for cell phones; and he even created a machine to crush discarded cell phones, in order to separate the parts and make them easier to recycle. In Brazil, phones must be sent abroad to be recycled due to lack of infrastructure; for his large installation of old phones and parts at SP-Arte, Bambozzi sourced broken phone parts from a local store that fixes phones, with a promise to ensure that the parts are recycled if the work is not sold.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

The works on view at SP-Arte touch upon issues of inequality in Brazil. One work, <em>Delírio Tropical #1 (Não existe pecado do lado de baixo do equador) </em>(2017), documents the coast of Maranhão, Brazil, where the tides are so varied that the ocean recedes eight meters over the course of six hours. The work mirrors the gap in the distribution of wealth in Brazil, where in the same place, there can be people flush with wealth, and others in poverty. Another work, <em>Delírio Tropical #2 (Ainda há chão)</em> (2017),is a reflection of the subtropical region. It pairs two images of jubilant people in saturated colors with a glass of cheap liquor, responding to a study that found that the region is home to great poverty.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

He presents a work from a new series of digital paintings printed on canvas, for which he simulates layers of brush strokes and daubs of paint, and intersperses them with digital, graphic motifs. While this painterly approach is new, the artist estimates he’s been working with the idea of “faking the medium” for some two decades. The work, <em>Untitled </em>(2017), is on offer for R$60,000 (approximately $19,000) and is one of the few digital works at the fair. “Digital hasn’t set foot in Brazil yet,” Simon said, which he suggested is due to conservative tastes. “People are not used to it, but if it’s on canvas it’s more acceptable.”</p><p><br></p><p>—Casey Lesser</p>"

We trip, we fall, we stumble—but we get up.” </p><p>The project Soren is referring to is an extensive <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/documentary-photography\">documentary series</a> she began in 2003, focusing on a group of players drafted by the Oakland Athletics the previous year. (Not coincidentally, the subject matter overlaps with a journalistic fixation of Soren’s husband, <em>Moneyball</em> author Michael Lewis.) A selection of those images are included in <em>Fantasy Life</em>, a recently released volume from Aperture, which spotlights Soren’s idiosyncratic outsider’s take on America’s favorite sport.</p><p>You most likely recall Soren from her stint as an on-camera MTV News journalist in the mid-90s, but since then, she has been quietly reinventing herself as an inventive fine-art photographer. For a series titled “Panic Beach,” she lugged a Hasselblad and a tripod to harsh coastal areas, standing precariously on rocks to capture crashing waves. The series was a way to sublimate her own visceral experience with an unexpected surge of anxiety attacks following her third pregnancy. For “Running,” she enlisted models to jog through moody landscapes, nodding to the carefully staged theatricality of major photographers like <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/gregory-crewdson\">Gregory Crewdson</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/philip-lorca-dicorcia\">Philip-Lorca diCorcia</a>.</p>"

(The series will be on view starting in May at Minnesota Street Project in San Francisco, and in late June at Kopeikin Gallery in Los Angeles.) She purposefully allowed fingerprints, sweat, and other human traces to remain on the surface, adding a ghostly, painterly layer to the resulting photographs, which contain such disparate subjects as Kim Gordon; riots in Ferguson, Missouri; Julian Assange; and Soren’s own teenage daughter. </p><p>Lately, she has also been working on images that she defaces, carves, or alters in some way—like a closely cropped photograph of a priest’s hands, the print punctured by a pellet gun, recently on view at the Whitney Houston Biennial, an alternative pop-up exhibition in New York.</p><p>Given this eclectic resume, Soren’s interest in baseball might seem a little, well…left-field. Initially, she approached the “Fantasy Life” series with an interest in straightforward documentary portraiture. She recalls seeing a 2011 retrospective of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/rineke-dijkstra\">Rineke Dijkstra</a> at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/sfmoma\">SFMoMA</a>; it included a series in which the Dutch artist photographed Israeli women before and after their mandatory military service, as well as Spanish bullfighters before and after their bloody stadium bouts.</p><p>Soren initially wanted to capture something similar with the Oakland A’s 2002 draft class—a way to track the “physical transformations of time” on the players’ bodies, she says. Eventually, however, the project became less about the appearances, and more about the pitfalls and challenges of professional success. “I got much more interested in the fact that many of the players were going to be released” from the Oakland team, she says. “It was going to be a series about falling from grace.”</p>"

The results have something in common with other sports images made by non-fans, like <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/catherine-opie\">Catherine Opie</a>’s “High School Football.” This was partially due to the fact that Soren didn’t want to revisit territory that has been amply and straightforwardly explored by generations of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/photojournalism\">photojournalists</a>. “That material seemed covered,” she jokes. “It’s like, if I went on a safari, I couldn’t imagine trying to pick up a camera. Do we really need another picture of a lion? They should get a break!” </p><p>Soren’s wandering focus amused the players. She recalls, during one practice game, being distracted by an on-field door whose metal facade had been dented and dinged by season after season of foul balls. The composition had a bit of everything, she says: the reflective surface, which created an “abstract still life” of its own, with the colors of turf and sky; and the physical imprint of flubbed, out-of-bounds hits. “There’s a game going on behind me, and the guys thought I had lost my mind,” she laughs. “<em>She’s taking pictures of our equipment-room door for 20 minutes</em>!” </p><p>The players weren’t the only ones who were occasionally confused by Soren’s mission. “The baseball world scratched its head, wondering why I spent so much time on a game that I’m not in love with,” Soren admits. “And the art world scratched its head about why an artist would spend so much time on something so <em>mainstream</em>. But I wanted to tell a new story, and I used baseball as a device.”</p>"

In one photograph of minor-leaguer Jonathan Joseph waiting to catch a fly ball, a too-thick area of emulsion added a ghostly cloud to the image. The player appears stunned by an almost holy aura lingering in the air. </p><p>“It’s like a religious ecstasy painting,” Soren says. “In any other circumstance, that’s a mess-up, but in this photograph it landed in the right place.” The aberrant tintype suited Soren’s idiosyncratic vision, but Joseph himself was not so easily won over. “He asked, don’t you have any of me <em>pitching</em>?”</p><p><br></p><p>—Scott Indrisek</p>"

At that point, although there were rumors that the NEA was on the chopping block, there had been no official confirmation from the administration. But when Trump released his first budget blueprint on March 16th, sure enough, the agency was slotted for elimination. “Towards the end it was a mad dash, because we really wanted to release it about a week after Trump had submitted his budget,” Brooks explained.</p><p>The site launched last week and currently features work by 20 artists, designers, and studios. Visitors to the website first select a work of art and enter their zip code.

Be it in the East or West, the epitome of a handsome man has generally been an idealized version of an upper-class individual, an archetype that has itself changed over time. </p><p>Because of this, people in many cultures have confronted muscle—today more commonly understood as a symbol of virile masculinity—as a problem. For much of history, muscles have been seen as vulgar, meaty indicators of labor; rather than strength they have suggested oafishness or, at best, potentially deviant self-regard. </p><p>Even today, we’re not clear on whether muscle is an indication of health or narcissism, menace or manliness. (And on women, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-how-art-has-shaped-female-beauty-ideals-history\">they present a whole other set of problems</a>.) The ideal man—the <em>gentle-man</em>—has no muscles because he does no physical work; he is also pale, because he has not toiled in the sun; and he is tall because he is well-nourished.</p><p>It’s a type that began to take shape in early 19th-century Europe, in England in particular, and held sway until very recently. Despite the more developed physiques found in <a href=\"http://c7.alamy.com/comp/AHY9J8/tarzan-the-ape-man-johnny-weissmuller-in-the-1932-film-AHY9J8.jpg\">Tarzan</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/terry-oneill-scottish-actor-sean-connery-as-james-bond-taking-a-bath-during-the-filming-of-diamonds-are-forever-las-vegas-1971\">James Bond</a> films, athleticism has been far less esteemed throughout history than a body formed by ease, alcohol, and cigarettes. And while the first mass fitness revolution occurred in the early ’70s, the masculine figure it celebrated—the thin, jogger’s frame—remained aesthetically identical to the old upper-class ideal, if perhaps a bit less winded.</p>"

Today, the cost of access to the highest-quality food and gyms, as well as to the best information about how both ought to be used, has spiked. As a result, privilege is signified by figures with low body-fat percentages that showcase taught muscles, by the leisure to afford long workouts in expensive gyms, by eating regimens crafted by coaches and trainers, by tans that bespeak travel, and by fitted, expensive clothing that accentuates these advantages. The greatest attitude shift, however, has been toward beefcake.</p><p>The notion of muscularity was reintroduced to the world in the mid-16th century, with the discovery of what came to be known as the Farnese Hercules, a Roman copy of an ancient Greek sculpture. But, it had an extremely limited influence until the current era. Only after the myths surrounding muscle—that it contributed to heart disease, made one slow and inflexible, and was not something produced through training but was instead a God-given marker of a low caste—were debunked did it become a marker of health and prosperity. </p><p>Oddly enough, the withering of gender stereotypes was just as powerful a filter in changing how male bodies are seen. As the vilification of homosexuality became less intense, male bodies were increasingly sexualized—and men’s attention to their appearances became acceptable. All forms of male self-fashioning—from building muscle to sartorial extravagance to grooming—have become not just socially accepted but expected. </p><p><br></p>"

          "body": "<p>On Friday, a group of graffiti artists won a significant legal victory against the real estate developers who demolished the graffiti haven known as “5 Pointz” in 2014. In an unexpected turn, a Brooklyn judge ruled against the developers, who had made a final request to dismiss the case before trial. </p><p>The judge’s ruling breathes new life into the three-and-a-half-year-long lawsuit, originally stymied by earlier decisions which allowed the property owners to destroy the graffiti and redevelop the site. Today, luxury rentals now reside on the Queens lot where the warehouse once sat. </p><p>In their pending suit, the graffiti artists argue that the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA)—which grants visual artists limited rights over work they created but do not own—entitles them to monetary damages for the destruction of their art. </p><p>The developers, meanwhile, asserted that such rights are narrow and inapplicable given that, while the artists are well-known, the works are not. As such, they aren’t covered by VARA. But in his ruling Friday, judge Frederic Block sided with the artists, stating that the evidence provided by both sides was sufficient to merit putting their VARA claims in front of a jury. </p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>Demolishing 5 Pointz</h2><p><br></p><p>The “aerosol” artists—as the court refers to them—are led by Jonathan Cohen, the most recent curator of the former graffiti mecca 5 Pointz. In the 1990s, while the building was mainly comprised of artist studios, the owner was asked to allow graffiti artists to work on the walls of the building. He agreed, and over time, the warehouse evolved into a living exhibition for local and international graffiti artists and fans alike. In the early 2000s, when Cohen assumed curative control, the building came to be known as 5 Pointz, named after the five boroughs of New York City. </p><p>Trouble began in 2013, when, after decades of this mutually beneficial arrangement, the owners voiced their intention to raze the warehouse and build a new housing development which would offer luxury rentals and a small selection of affordable units. The same year, Cohen and the others sued to prevent the destruction of their works which, at that time, still adorned the walls of the warehouse. </p><p>After initially delaying the development, the judge eventually denied the artists’ requests for permanent action in November 2013—though he left the door open for the artists to pursue monetary damages. The developers proceeded to whitewash the building overnight, allowing it to sit for months <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/nyregion/5pointz-a-graffiti-mecca-in-queens-is-wiped-clean-overnight.html\">before</a> it was eventually razed. This quick, perhaps unnecessary, washing of the graffiti served as a gut-punch to the artists who had pursued legal action to save the walls they saw as an extension of themselves. </p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>VARA and Its Limits</h2><p><br></p><p>The 5 Pointz artists’s case against the developers stems from the Visual Artists Rights Act—or VARA for short. Passed in 1990, the law provides what are known as moral rights to artists behind qualifying works of visual art. Namely, it grants the rights to attribution and integrity. The right to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A\">integrity</a>, as invoked in the 5 Pointz lawsuit, provides artists with the ability to “to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature” even if that work exists on property owned by someone else—in this case, the building’s developers.</p><p>But VARA provides narrow protection with limited application compared to European laws dealing with similar issues. VARA’s right to integrity is limited in applicability to original copies of qualified works of <em>visual</em> art (thereby excluding music and other non-visual art). Additionally, the rights last only for the life of the artist, and may also be waived by the artist.</p><p>A significant limitation of VARA, and one which lies at the core of this case, is that a work must be of a “recognized stature” in order to prevent its destruction under the statute. Additionally, though the text of the statute states the ability to “prevent destruction,” courts are often limited in their abilities to actually follow through with this remedy, since they are required to weigh competing interests, including that of the property owner.</p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>VARA and 5 Pointz</h2><p><br></p><p>In refusing to prohibit the destruction of the artwork of 5 Pointz in 2013, the judge employed a narrow reading of VARA. That is, he ruled the statute provides monetary recourse for the destruction of visual works of “recognized stature,” but not the ability to indefinitely preserve the works. Since moving the art in this case was not an option, the only way to preserve it would have been to preserve the entire building, perhaps as a tourist attraction or cultural landmark. Judge Block noted that such remedies were wholly outside of those that the court had authority to grant under the statute. </p><p>Instead, he considered that the a monetary reward would make the artists whole. While this hollow reading of the statute was disappointing, it allowed for artists to seek monetary damages remains after destruction—which they did. Though developers had sought to prevent even an economic reward, Judge Block’s ruling Friday allows the artists claim to monetary damages under VARA to proceed. </p><p>One of the earliest cases to consider this issue and provide an important precedent coincidentally also took place in Queens. In <em>Carter v. Helmsley Spear, Inc.</em>, a developer removed a sculpture in a building he was renovating. The artist sued, relying on VARA for monetary damages. The court held that whether a work was of “recognized stature” under VARA must consider <em>both</em> whether the art “was viewed as meritorious,” and also whether art critics, experts, and other members of the art community considered that the art was “recognized.” </p><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>The Case Ahead</h2><p><br></p><p>This will be a critical issue in the 5 Pointz case. As the lawsuit proceeds to trial, each side will present art experts to voice their opinion on whether or not the work is important and well recognized. It will be up to the jury, based on the facts presented, to decide. </p><p>There is little doubt that Cohen and the other artists will be able to make a strong showing. 5 Pointz, both in life and in death, has been an institution for graffiti artists, widely acclaimed and discussed in both the local and international press. And a Brooklyn jury is likely to be sympathetic to the artists amid the constant churn of gentrifying landscapes. </p><p>The legal battle and eventual destruction of 5 Pointz also significantly raised its profile, which could have a positive impact on the damages, as the “stature” of the works is now exceptionally well-documented.</p><p>One potentially derailing factor, though, is that the court is of the view that each particular work should be considered separately. The judge has asked the artists to present a “final list” of all the works, so he may determine whether the claims will be managed by a single jury or multiple juries. &nbsp;</p><p>As moral rights in this country have evolved over the years, in some ways they have diverged from their original purpose. The emphasis on allowing artists to pursue monetary damages rather than a more holistic approach which protects the art for the public demonstrates the economic lens through which the United States views artists’ rights. Such a focus flies directly in the face of the purpose of moral rights. Still, one can understand the judicial need to assign financial value and rely on concrete evidence in these types of cases.</p><p>Regardless of how the 5 Pointz lawsuit plays out, it reflects a gaping hole in legislative protection of artists’ rights. In particular, putting a fixed economic value on a work’s destruction limits its value to the financial, failing to consider the work’s ineffable cultural contribution to the public writ large.</p><p><br></p><p>—Jessica Meiselman</p>"

Keynes was an art lover and supporter, a friend of artists, and a canny art collector, whose collection of 135 works was bequeathed to Cambridge University’s King’s College. </p><p>It’s that slice of his extraordinary life that economists David Chambers, Elroy Dimson, and Christophe Spaenjers studied for their forthcoming paper, “Art Portfolios,” to better understand the long-run performance of art as an asset class. Keynes’s “portfolio,” or art collection, was amassed for less than £13,000. By 2013, it was valued at over £70 million, for an annualized real rate of return of 4.2% over the past half-century—virtually matching the performance of the total return on equities over the same period. So what does their analysis tell us about the art market?</p><p>By analyzing the performance of Keynes’s collection, and comparing it with the simulated performance of thousands of hypothetical art portfolios, they found that the art market was structured much like a lottery, with relatively few winners (artists and their collectors) reaping enormous gains, and the bulk of artists marginal to the overall value of the market. This will be entirely unsurprising to anyone who has stood on an Christie’s or Sotheby’s saleroom floor or perused the aisles of major art fairs like Art Basel or Frieze.</p><p>The art market has also largely eluded various attempts to estimate, measure, and index it. Historically, around half of transactions happen in the private market (in recent years that figure has crept higher), but publicly available auction records only include prices for works that successfully find a buyer. This can skew estimates of returns in auction-based indexes, although the exact nature of this bias is still being studied. In addition, consignors tend to sell works at auction when they expect a high return, meaning that auction-based indexes may overestimate returns due to this “selection bias.” </p><p>Keynes’s portfolio is somewhat unique in entirety avoiding these pitfalls, according to the authors. “It is one of only two complete, or near-complete, financial records of an art collection from initial purchase to final valuation,” they wrote, adding that it is the only one that also includes valuations at other intervening points in time. The other, the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz, auctioned at Christie’s in 1997, was noted for its “extraordinary financial value,” while Keynes’s collection, by contrast, had no particular renown. It also came with extensive documentation of the purchases and why he made them. </p><p>“To our knowledge this was the only one where we could really observe purchase decisions by an art portfolio, then track the value of the collection’s items over time,” said Spaenjers, an associate finance professor at the business school HEC Paris. “You see all these decisions being played out over many decades.…You can see how his purchase decisions changed with his personal fortune.”</p><p>And while it was not sold off, the collection has been valued over the years by insurers, auction houses, and finally through independent appraisals ordered by the study’s authors in 2013. </p><p>“In creating indexes, they’re always hypothetical,” said William Goetzmann, a Yale University finance professor who has previously collaborated with Spaenjers. “Lots of us have spent time trying to do indexes, but we really don’t know whether those represent the true return to investing…this has the special virtue that it’s an actual portfolio.”</p><p>Their analysis and comparison with hypothetical portfolios revealed several features of Keynes’s collection with implications for the broader market. One is the importance of the purchase channel. Keynes’s “winning lottery tickets”—in art world terms, paintings and drawings by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/edgar-degas\">Degas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/paul-cezanne\">Cezanne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/georges-braque\">Braque</a>—were largely purchased at auction, where Spaenjers guessed he was able to spot bargains. (Incidentally, Keynes was also known to be an excellent stock picker.) The works he acquired through other channels, through dealers and on the primary market, underperformed relative to his auction purchases. Of course, Keynes wasn’t simply lucky; he had what today’s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513896351/black-edge-recounts-the-biggest-insider-trading-scandal-in-history\">hedge funders call “edge,”</a> insider tips shared through artist friends, including his one-time lover, the English painter <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/duncan-grant\">Duncan Grant</a>. Spaenjers said Keynes also appeared to time his purchases well, for example, buying works by <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/anthony-van-dyck\">van Dyck</a> at auction when prices were low, or buying in Paris after World War I when the market was likely depressed. </p><p>Another characteristic of Keynes’s portfolio is its high level of concentration, with 80% of his total art spend going to just 10 works. In 2013, the 10 most valuable works accounted for 91% of the portfolio’s total value. “Changes in the total value of the Keynes collection are largely driven by changes in the market value of a few artists, such as Braque, Cezanne, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse\">Matisse</a>, Picasso and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/georges-seurat\">Seurat</a>,” the authors concluded. “Conversely, what happens to all the lesser-known artists…is not an important driver of returns.” Keynes’s portfolio performance points to an enduring quality of the broader art market (and, increasingly, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707838-dearth-competition-among-firms-helps-explain-wage-inequality-and-host-other\">the economy at large</a>), that it’s a “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803469?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">superstar economy</a>,” in which works by a few highly sought-after artists reap outsized returns. For example, the 20 best performing artists at auction have changed little over the past decade, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-art-basel-report-suggests-growing-inequality-endangering-art-market\">topped by perennial names</a> like <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/bruce-nauman\">Bruce Nauman</a>, and Pablo Picasso, according to The Art Market | 2017, a recently released <a href=\"https://www.artbasel.com/about/initiatives/the-art-market\">report</a> from Art Basel and UBS. </p><p>Savvy art investors, at this point, likely know that executing a “buy low, sell high” strategy is easier said than done, given that so few young artists go on to command serious prices at auction. But even a portfolio diversification strategy (the idea behind mutual funds that hold a wide array of equities) is hard to implement when it comes to art, as this study highlights. When so much of the value of Keynes’s portfolio lay in a handful of key works, and buying them required significant upfront investment, successful arts investment appears to be a game for the already well-capitalized. </p><p>Still, the opacity of the art market does leave potential for well-positioned and deeply informed insiders to take advantage of information asymmetries, such as knowing when a work might become available or where a willing buyer lies. And in the study’s simulated portfolios, constructed at random from a global database of auction transactions, roughly a third of even small portfolios outperformed the equity market, a function the wide range of performance (most of them significantly underperformed). The key variable, of course, was the presence or absence of one of the “lottery ticket” artists in the hypothetical portfolio. </p><p>“There’s such wide variation that you can’t really conclude [Keynes] was ‘skilled,’” said Spaenjers. “But what you do see from reading about his life and his decisions is that he was given advice by his artist friends. It’s the type of edge that probably still could today play a role, especially in the contemporary market.”</p><p><br></p><p>—Anna Louie Sussman</p>"

Four of Kiefer’s life-size replicas of 20th-century warplanes inhabit one of CC’s four former paper halls. &nbsp;</p><p>Two of these are modeled on the U.S. Army’s F-84F Thunderstreak, a snub-nosed plane used during the Korean War. A larger sculpture is based on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, a heavy American bomber plane used on Germany during World War II. And a fourth sculpture, titled<em> Exodus, </em>is after the twin-engined Martin B-26 Marauder, first flown in 1940 and used by the British, French, U.S., and South African air forces.</p><p>The works—three of them built with Kiefer’s trademark material, lead, the other with zinc—have never before left Kiefer’s studio in France. Although planes have been a motif in his work since the 1980s, and the artist also collects decommissioned military jets, this is the first time so many of them have been seen at a single show. </p>"

The book—which follows its protagonist Bardamu through his personal accounts of World War I, colonialism in Africa, and a Ford factory in Detroit—has influenced many artists, especially the male icons of modernist and existentialist writing, like Beckett, Barthes, and Bukowski. </p><p>“It’s one of the most astonishing books of the 20th century, but he was an asshole, yes,” Kiefer said, with trenchant humor that is not always obvious in his work. Indeed Céline’s legacy has been tainted by his anti-Semitic writing and support of the Axis powers during World War II. </p><p>After Kiefer’s appearance at the Venice Biennale in 1980, the artist was himself accused of neo-Nazism. So why reference someone like Céline now? “He was a horrible man, but a great writer,” said Kiefer. &nbsp;“You have to separate, you know. There can be bad characters who are great writers, or good artists, it happens.”</p><p>The book is what matters, Kiefer insists. <em>Voyage au bout de la nuit, </em>he said, “was nihilistic, but not in a negative way. He created an anti-world.” </p><p>War and humanity’s destitution have been at the center of Kiefer’s work for five decades. One can only imagine the artist has been ruminating on our current world, with mounting tensions in North Korea, talk of a second Cold War, and right-wing populism sweeping through the West.</p><p>“When I started to work in the 1960s, I said 1945 is not the beginning of a new time,” he explained. “I said all the morass is still there, it’s covered with a thin layer of democracy, but it’s still there. It can go up anytime. And now we live in a time that’s very dangerous. We have horrible things happening, because mankind is wrongly constructed.”</p>"

Usually these were courses at a local community college or, occasionally, private classes for small groups. But these would need to be one-on-one lessons, Nelson explained, because this was no ordinary student. Former president George W. Bush wanted to learn how to paint.</p><p>“I was speechless,” Norfleet says.</p><p>Nelson, a close friend of both Bush and his wife, made the introduction. Norfleet soon met the Bushes in person at their Dallas home, kicking off her two-year stint as an art teacher for the former political leader. The pair met for three hours each Monday, in a home office that had been transformed into a studio. “Laura Bush called it a man cave,” Norfleet says with a laugh.</p><p>In 2013, when Bush’s initial forays into painting were <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/02/nude-self-portrait-george-w-bush-critique\">revealed</a> via an email hack, his practice was suddenly thrust into the spotlight. These early works, including bizarre self-portraits of Bush in the bathtub and shower, spawned countless articles questioning the former president’s new hobby. Now, four years later, he’s again stirring up press with his portraits of veterans who were active in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—conflicts that Bush himself began during his presidency. </p>"

Along the way, Bush charmed audiences and joked with TV personalities on talk shows, waxing poetic about embracing his “inner <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-1\">Rembrandt</a>.” </p><p>Journalists from various publications duly issued warnings about “normalizing” the former president. They reminded audiences that Bush’s current, painterly persona does nothing to redeem the actions he took while in office—something, they noted, that can feel particularly tempting in light of the current administration. </p><p>Within the art community, many have warily admitted that Bush has a way with paint. He’s developed his style over the years, working with a string of artist teachers including <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jim-woodson\">Jim Woodson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/sedrick-huckaby\">Sedrick Huckaby</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/roger-winter\">Roger Winter</a>, and Bonnie Flood.</p><p>It was Norfleet, however, who first introduced him to painting half a decade ago. “He was looking for a new project,” she recalls. Already an avid golfer and bike rider, as well as an active participant in the programming of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, Norfleet notes that “he needed a new challenge.”</p><p>She started him off just as she would any novice in a beginner painting class. “I am fairly traditional,” she says of her teaching style. Her classes begin with exercises to explore oil paint and brushes, before moving on to work with colors, transitions from light to shadow, and, finally, to painting still lifes.</p><p>Without fellow students, she worried that the former world leader might be irked by her hovering over his shoulder and critiquing his technique. On the contrary, he reminded her, “I’m used to scrutiny.”</p>"

He did so, creating the paintings leaked in 2013; along with his feet poking out of the bathtub, these included several canine portraits and a bucolic church scene. “It kind of took off; he was very prolific right from the beginning.” </p><p>Interwoven in their lessons was art-historical context. “It&#x27;s important for an artist to know where they fit,” Norfleet explains. “At first he was a little bit reluctant to think about art history,” she adds, noting that it took a few months of lessons before he agreed to take an online course through the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/museum-of-modern-art\">Museum of Modern Art</a> exploring the development of painting from the 1800s through 1945. She introduced him to the work of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/lucian-freud\">Lucian Freud</a>, who was at that time the subject of a retrospective at the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/themodernfw\">Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a>.</p><p>Bush’s competitive nature and confidence worked in his favor. “He was quick, he had a good memory,” Norfleet says. “Oil paint moves; you can put it down and then take it away, and he was not afraid to make marks that were wrong.”</p><p>At the time, Norfleet herself was creating figurative work, painting her students in the classroom, as well as people looking at art. “A figurative thing was going on in my head at the time; I was looking at so many different people, which made it fitting when we started the world figures series,” she explains.</p><p>Under Norfleet’s tutelage, Bush completed a series of more than 24 world leaders, from his father, George H.W. Bush, to the Dalai Lama. These works went on display at his presidential library in 2014. Since then, other teachers have inspired Bush to delve into new subject matter—most recently the controversial portraits of veterans.</p>"

Since that time, generations of artists—from <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/henry-moore\">Henry Moore</a> to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/isamu-noguchi\">Isamu Noguchi</a> to <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/damien-hirst\">Damien Hirst</a>—have followed in the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/renaissance\">Renaissance</a> master’s footsteps, each employing the Italian region’s exquisite marble for their own works. </p><p>Irish sculptor <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/kevin-francis-gray\">Kevin Francis Gray</a> joined their ranks in 2006, when he first traveled to Pietrasanta in search of a workshop. He set up a meeting with the Giannoni family—marble artisans with a long history of replicating iconic Vatican sculptures. Gray, who was interested in slowing down production of his work, was drawn to their adherence to centuries-old, manual methods—rather than the mechanical processes now in use by many studios in the area. </p><p>At first, the Giannonis were hesitant about the idea of making contemporary work. The studio frequently turns down commissions; even today, they partner with just one other contemporary artist, the Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/giuseppe-penone\">Giuseppe Penone</a>. But then Marco Giannoni, a fourth-generation artisan and current head of the studio, saw a resin cast of Gray’s work <em>Ghost Girl </em>(2007). Though it’s fashioned in a traditional style, the sculpture of a young girl, with her head bent and hands clasped behind her back, has flashes of modernity—slashed wrists and a long, beaded curtain of Swarovski crystals concealing her face. “Kevin already had such interesting ideas, even back then,” Giannoni <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tuscan-marble-studio-honors-bygone-traditions-1490281994\">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. </p><p>Gray’s most recent body of work, on view now at <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/pace-gallery\">Pace Gallery</a>, ventures even further from traditional sculpture. Although he’s concealed the identity of his subjects in much of his previous work—often through veils or draped cloth—in these works he does so in a markedly different manner. He’s created several busts and full-body nudes and then gouged and reshaped them with probing fingers—a vivid reminder of the sculptor’s hand at work. </p>"

Gray’s studio manager Anakena Paddon says they want to enhance that feeling with their decision to allow visitors to touch the works in the gallery. “It’s so enticing,” she says. “You want to put your hands where the artist’s hand has been. When you feel how hard the rock is, you also realize the amount of manual labor that’s gone into the production. It’s a really moving experience.” </p><p>The production of each sculpture is no small feat. First, Gray crafts a clay model in his London studio, which is then cast in plaster and sent to the marble workshop in Pietrasanta. There, it is translated from plaster to stone by a team of trained artisans. The block itself can take some two to three weeks to select; Gray relies on Giannoni’s intuition and experience to sense if there may be a hidden flaw in the stone. Then it takes months—six to nine for a bust, or up to a year for a full-length nude—to realize the final sculptures. </p><p>Although any work to come out of the studio will follow this process, the sculptures for the Pace show were particularly time-intensive. Before they began work on these sculptures, there were just three artisans staffing the studio. As the work progressed, the team swelled to eight; the 76-year-old Piero Quadrelli, a master at carving a rough form into the block of marble, even came out of retirement to pitch in. The work was unlike anything they’d done before, even the contemporary pieces they had crafted for Gray’s previous shows—many of which were based on Neoclassical sculpture. In total, seven works on view at Pace took three years to complete.</p>"

Hirst, in fact, never visited the studio that produced his £1 million <em>Anatomy of an Angel </em>(2008) (he approved the work through photographs). But Gray visits Italy often, spending some 10 days each month in the studio. Not only is he there to supervise, but he actually handles the fine detailing of the sculptures himself.</p><p>It’s not easy work, he notes. Carving kicks up so much white marble dust that the artisans are jokingly referred to as the “ghosts of Pietrasanta.” Gray’s favorite part of the process is the end. “It’s so labor-intensive and so emotionally and physically attritional, it’s such a joy to walk away from a piece.”</p><p>Michelangelo’s presence in the town has been well documented; bronze plaques mark houses where, centuries ago, he may have slept, while a local cafe claims the distinction of serving as his workspace during a visit in 1518. But the connection is even more explicit in Gray’s Pace show. One piece, titled <em>Cave Girl </em>(2016), was carved from a block of marble extracted from the very same cave Michelangelo sourced for his marble back in the 1500s. </p><p>“They’re using the same techniques that <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/antonio-canova\">Canova</a> did, that Michelangelo’s studio did,” Paddon says of the Giannoni workshop. “It’s a way of work and life that is facing extinction because it’s obviously intensely laborious. But it’s a really beautiful process as well. It’s living history.”</p><p><br></p><p>—Abigail Cain</p>"
