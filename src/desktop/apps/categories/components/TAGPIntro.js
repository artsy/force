        The Art Genome Project is the classification system and technological
        framework that powers Artsy. It maps the characteristics (we call them
        &ldquo;genes&rdquo;) that connect artists, artworks, architecture, and
        design objects across history. There are currently over 1,000
        characteristics in The Art Genome Project, including art historical
        movements, subject matter, and formal qualities.
