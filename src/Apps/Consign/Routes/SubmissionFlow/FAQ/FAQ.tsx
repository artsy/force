          There are no upfront fees. When the artwork sells, we charge a nominal
          seller’s commission as a percentage of the sale price. The commission
          is determined based on the total value of works you sell with us. You
          won’t be asked to cover any additional costs, such as shipping,
          insurance, or photography. <br />

          We hold multiple themed auctions per month, which means your artwork
          can be sold at auction within 2–6 weeks. Timing of private sales or
          direct listing on Artsy can vary; chat with one of our specialists to
          learn more.

            Currently, Artsy does not directly partner with artists outside of

            galleries, museums, and other institutions.

          To assess a work’s value, our team uses publicly available auction
          results, as well as Artsy’s own database of primary market sales. We
          also take into account market trends (including both an individual
          artist’s market and macro trends in the art market), artwork
          condition, and sales channel, as well as other factors that may impact
          a work’s value, such as medium, provenance, subject matter, or period.
