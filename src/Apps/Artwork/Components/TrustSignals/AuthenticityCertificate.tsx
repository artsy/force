              A certificate of authenticity (COA) is a document from an
              authoritative source that verifies the artworkâ€™s authenticity.
              While many COAs are signed by the artist, others will be signed by
              the representing gallery or the printmaker who collaborated with
              the artist on the work. For secondary market works, authorized
              estates or foundations are often the issuing party.

            <Text variant="sm">
              COAs typically include the name of the artist, the details (title,
              date, medium, dimensions) of the work in question, and whenever
              possible an image of the work.
