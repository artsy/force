        <Expandable label="What does it cost to sell with Artsy?">
          <TextItem>
            We offer no upfront fees. When the artwork sells, we charge a
            nominal seller’s commission as a percentage of the sale price. The
            commission is determined based on the total value of works you sell
            with us. You won’t be asked to cover any additional costs, such as
            shipping, insurance, or photography. <br />

        <Expandable label="What happens once I submit an artwork?">
          <TextItem>
            Based on our proprietary market data, we will let you know within 48
            hours whether your artwork has sufficient demand within the
            secondary market. If so, your work will be approved. Once approved,
            you will receive an offer from Artsy to include your work in an
            upcoming online auction. The offer will have an estimated artwork
            range and auction details. If you are interested in selling your
            work based on the offer, you can accept it or ask further questions
            to our specialists, who will guide you through the process.

        <Expandable label="How is selling with Artsy different from consigning with a traditional auction house?">
          <TextItem>
            Unlike a consignment with a traditional auction house, Artsy does
            not require any upfront costs of shipping, insurance, or marketing.
            This means no upfront fees for you. This also allows you to sell
            your work in an online auction faster, as we hold multiple auctions
            a month. In case your work doesn’t find a buyer right away, the
            auction results won’t be published and the work won’t get “burned.”

        <Expandable label="How long does it take to sell art with Artsy?">
          <TextItem>
            We hold multiple themed auctions per month, which means that your
            artwork can be sold within 2–6 weeks.
