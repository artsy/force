            A certificate of authenticity (COA) is a document from an
            authoritative source that verifies the artworkâ€™s authenticity. While
            many COAs are signed by the artist, others will be signed by the
            representing gallery or the printmaker who collaborated with the
            artist on the work. For secondary market works, authorized estates
            or foundations are often the issuing party.

          <Text variant="sm">
            COAs typically include the name of the artist, the details (title,
            date, medium, dimensions) of the work in question, and whenever
            possible an image of the work.
