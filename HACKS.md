## patches/react-spring+8.0.27.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

The `react-spring` library leaks locally due to a cleanup routine that only executes in `componentWillUnmount`, this patches the controller cache `Set` to be a `WeakSet` so that references are no longer held onto when the components have been garbage collected.

Slack: https://artsy.slack.com/archives/CA8SANW3W/p1624453974296000

#### When can we remove this:

When we have removed the references to `react-spring` from `@artsy/palette`

## patches/relay-mock-network-layer+2.0.0.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

Added to better support our custom relay test tools, but has been superceded in favor of official relay testing tools. This still remains because of old code tests.

#### When can we remove this:

Can be removed when old relay test code has been deleted, and our legacy Relay dev tools in v2/Devtools is no longer used.

## patches/relay-runtime+9.1.0.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

Understanding of why this is here is vague. Seemingly in support of our metaphysics v2 / relay 7 upgrade, when we got off of our custom relay fork, but not entirely sure.

#### When can we remove this:

Uncertain.

## patches/relay-compiler+9.1.0.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

Added in order to support click-to-definition in Relay compiler error output

#### When can we remove this:

This is safe to remove whenever; however, the dev experience isn't as nice.

## patches/found+0.5.5.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

Added in order to support proper types in `findCurrentRoute`.

#### When can we remove this:

When correct types are added to found.
