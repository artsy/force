## patches/relay-mock-network-layer+2.0.0.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

Added to better support our custom relay test tools, but has been superceded in favor of official relay testing tools. This still remains because of old code tests.

Can be removed when old relay test code has been deleted, and our legacy Relay dev tools in v2/Devtools is no longer used.

## patches/found+0.5.5.patch

#### Explanation/Context:

Added in order to support proper types in `findCurrentRoute`.

#### When can we remove this:

When correct types are added to found.
