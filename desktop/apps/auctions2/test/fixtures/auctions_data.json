Through our mission and programs, Visual AIDS makes the work of HIV+ artists more accessible and visible. We provide a forum for conversations about artists and their work alongside issues like art activism, inequity in health resources, social justice, and the diverse communities affected by HIV/AIDS, offering perspectives often absent from the national dialogue. \r\n\r\nThis auction supports the work of Visual AIDS and is part of the 12th annual Visual AIDS Vanguard Awards (VAVA VOOM) that recognize individuals who, through their work and talent, have used art and activism to raise awareness and fight AIDS. \r\n\r\nBidding will be open exclusively on Artsy, and will close at **10:00 PM ET on May 22, 2017**.

      "description":"Creative Time, the New York based public arts non-profit, is committed to working with artists on the dialogues, debates and dreams of our time. Since 1974, Creative Time has produced over 350 groundbreaking public art projects that ignite the imagination, explore ideas that shape society, and engage millions of people around the globe, as well as the Creative Time Summit - an international convening at the intersection of art and social justice.\r\n \r\nOn June 14th, Flag Day, Creative Time launches ***Pledges of Allegiance***, a serialized commission of sixteen flags, each one created by an acclaimed artist: **Tania Bruguera, Alex Da Corte, Jeremy Deller, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Ann Hamilton, Robert Longo, Josephine Meckseper, Marilyn Minter, Vik Muniz, Jayson Musson, Ahmet Ögüt, Yoko Ono, Trevor Paglen, Pedro Reyes, Rirkrit Tiravanija,** and **Nari Ward.**  Conceived in response to the current political climate, each flag points to an issue the artist is passionate about, a cause they believe is worth fighting for, and speaks to how we might move forward collectively.  The project kicks-off with Marilyn Minter’s *RESIST FLAG* raised on the roof of Creative Time’s headquarters in New York City. For more information on *Pledges of Allegiance* and Creative Time, click [here](http://creativetime.org/projects/pledgesofallegiance/).\r\n \r\nAll proceeds from the *Pledges of Allegiance* auction go towards supporting the project and Creative Time’s visionary programming, while simultaneously sending a powerful show of solidarity in the belief that artistic expression, more than ever, is essential to the public sphere.\r\n \r\nFrom June 21 - June 28, all the flags featured in the auction will be on display at Salon94, Freeman Alley, located at 1 Freeman Alley, New York, NY, 10002. The gallery is open Tuesday - Saturday, 11am - 6pm. Stop in to see them in person!",
