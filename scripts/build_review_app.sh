# review application for Force. It draws upon Artsy's existing review app
# documentation:
# https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/blob/master/docs/Review_Apps.md and
# experiences trying to set up review apps!

# USAGE: $ ./scripts/build_review_app.sh review-app-name

# Bail out of script on first expression failure and echo the commands as
# they are being run.

# WARNING: This is likely going to take ~10 mins on your MBP.
