# Description: Run this script to automate the process of building Hokusai
# review application for Force. It draws upon Artsy's existing review app
# documentation:
# https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/blob/master/docs/Review_Apps.md and
# experiences trying to set up review apps!

# USAGE: $ ./scripts/build_review_app.sh review-app-name

echo "[build_review_app.sh] START"

# Bail out of script on first expression failure and sprint the commands as
# they are being run.

# Create the Docker image of your current working direct of Force, and push
# it to Artsy's docker registry.
#
# --force is needed as the current working directory is dirty with (at least)
# the YAML file generated above.
# --skip-latest as we're making no claim that this is the "latest" build of the
# service.
# --tag to name the image.
# WARNING: This is likely going to take ~10 mins on your MBP.
# Be patient and grab some baby carrots.
hokusai registry push --force --skip-latest --verbose --tag $NAME

# Edit the K8S YAML to reference the proper Docker image
# sed -i '' 's/:staging/:auct-281/g' hokusai/auct-281.yml

# The weird `-i ''` is needed on MacOS:
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/44864004
# WARNING: This might not work on Linux.
sed -i '' "s/:staging/:$NAME/g" hokusai/$NAME.yml

# Edit the K8S YAML to remove the instructions that enforce that the service
# can only be accessible via Cloudflare
#
# First, remove the `loadBalancerSourceRanges:` line
sed -i '' '/loadBalancer/d' hokusai/$NAME.yml

# Then, delete all the IP address lines.
#
# WARNING: This is a bit sketchy as this will
# delete any line of the form "- [number][number][number].". This is my best
# approx for an regex for an IP address, and I'm sure that there are better
# ones.

# To enable authentication via Force's server, we need to allow XHR requests

# yeah, I'm talking to you
# you need to configure a CNAME record so that $NAME.artsy.net resolves to" \
# the service's external IP:
#
echo $(kubectl get service force-web --namespace $NAME --context staging -o json \
  | jq .status.loadBalancer.ingress[].hostname)
#
# you may do this in the DynDNS interface. Credentials are in 1pass
