  "readme": "# buffer (native-buffer-browserify)\n[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/feross/buffer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/feross/buffer)\n[![NPM Version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/buffer.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/buffer)\n[![NPM](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/buffer.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/buffer)\n[![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/feross.svg)](https://www.gittip.com/feross/)\n\nThe buffer module from [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), for the browser.\n\n[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/feross/buffer.png)](https://ci.testling.com/feross/buffer)\n\n## install\n\nWhen you `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global in [browserify](http://github.com/substack/node-browserify), this module will automatically load.\n\nIf you want to manually install it for some reason, do:\n\n```\nnpm install buffer\n```\n\n## features\n\n- Backed by Typed Arrays (`Uint8Array` and `ArrayBuffer`) (not `Object`, so it's fast)\n- Extremely small bundle size (**5.04KB minified + gzipped**, 35.5KB with comments)\n- Excellent browser support (IE 6+, Chrome 4+, Firefox 3+, Safari 5.1+, Opera 11+, iOS, etc.)\n- Preserves Node API exactly, with one important difference (see below)\n- Faster pretty much across the board (see perf results below)\n- `.slice()` returns instances of the same type (Buffer)\n- Square-bracket `buf[4]` notation works, even in old browsers like IE6!\n- Does not modify any browser prototypes or put anything on `window`.\n- Comprehensive test suite.\n\n\n## usage\n\n```\nvar Buffer = require('buffer/').Buffer  // use the npm module, not the core module!\n```\n\nThe goal is to provide a Buffer API that is 100% identical to node's Buffer API. Read the [official docs](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for a full list of supported methods.\n\n\n## differences\n\n#### important: you must use `Buffer.isBuffer` instead of `instanceof Buffer`\n\nThe Buffer constructor returns a `Uint8Array` (with all the Buffer methods added as\nproperties on the instance) for performance reasons, so `instanceof Buffer` won't work. In\nnode `Buffer.isBuffer` is the same as `instanceof Buffer`, but in the browser you must use\n`Buffer.isBuffer` to detect the special `Uint8Array`-based Buffers.\n\n#### minor: `slice()` does not modify the memory of the parent buffer in all browsers\n\nIn node, the `slice()` method returns a new `Buffer` that shares underlying memory with\nthe original Buffer. When you modify one buffer, you modify the other. [Read more.](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_slice_start_end)\n\nIn all browsers that support typed arrays (with the exception of Firefox 4-29), this behavior is preserved. Browsers that don't support typed arrays get an alternate buffer implementation based on `Object`, which is slower and lacks the correct `slice()` semantics.\n\nFirefox versions <= 29 get the `Object` implementation -- not the typed arrays one -- because of [this\nbug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=952403) that made it impossible to add properties to a typed array. Fortunatly, the good folks at Mozilla have since fixed this bug.\n\nIf you only support the latest browsers and/or don't rely on this behavior of `slice()`,\nthen you have nothing to worry about. If you do rely on this behavior then note that your\ncode won't work in browsers without typed arrays and Firefox <= 29.\n\n\n## how does it work?\n\nThe `Buffer` constructor returns instances of `Uint8Array` that are augmented with function properties for all the Buffer API functions. We use `Uint8Array` so that square bracket notation works as expected -- it returns a single octet.\n\nBy augmenting the instances, we can avoid modifying the `Uint8Array` prototype.\n\n\n## performance\n\nSee perf tests in `/perf`.\n\n```\n# Chrome 33\n\nNewBuffer#bracket-notation x 11,194,815 ops/sec ±1.73% (64 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#bracket-notation x 9,546,694 ops/sec ±0.76% (67 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#bracket-notation\n\nNewBuffer#concat x 949,714 ops/sec ±2.48% (63 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#concat x 634,906 ops/sec ±0.42% (68 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#concat\n\nNewBuffer#copy x 15,436,458 ops/sec ±1.74% (67 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#copy x 3,990,346 ops/sec ±0.42% (68 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#copy\n\nNewBuffer#readDoubleBE x 1,132,954 ops/sec ±2.36% (65 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#readDoubleBE x 846,337 ops/sec ±0.58% (68 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#readDoubleBE\n\nNewBuffer#new x 1,419,300 ops/sec ±3.50% (66 runs sampled)\nUint8Array#new x 3,898,573 ops/sec ±0.88% (67 runs sampled) (used internally by NewBuffer)\nOldBuffer#new x 2,284,568 ops/sec ±0.57% (67 runs sampled)\nFastest is Uint8Array#new\n\nNewBuffer#readFloatBE x 1,203,763 ops/sec ±1.81% (68 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#readFloatBE x 954,923 ops/sec ±0.66% (70 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#readFloatBE\n\nNewBuffer#readUInt32LE x 750,341 ops/sec ±1.70% (66 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#readUInt32LE x 1,408,478 ops/sec ±0.60% (68 runs sampled)\nFastest is OldBuffer#readUInt32LE\n\nNewBuffer#slice x 1,802,870 ops/sec ±1.87% (64 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#slice x 1,725,928 ops/sec ±0.74% (68 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#slice\n\nNewBuffer#writeFloatBE x 830,407 ops/sec ±3.09% (66 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#writeFloatBE x 508,446 ops/sec ±0.49% (69 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#writeFloatBE\n\n# Node 0.11\n\nNewBuffer#bracket-notation x 10,912,085 ops/sec ±0.89% (92 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#bracket-notation x 9,051,638 ops/sec ±0.84% (92 runs sampled)\nBuffer#bracket-notation x 10,721,608 ops/sec ±0.63% (91 runs sampled)\nFastest is NewBuffer#bracket-notation\n\nNewBuffer#concat x 1,438,825 ops/sec ±1.80% (91 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#concat x 888,614 ops/sec ±2.09% (93 runs sampled)\nBuffer#concat x 1,832,307 ops/sec ±1.20% (90 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#concat\n\nNewBuffer#copy x 5,987,167 ops/sec ±0.85% (94 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#copy x 3,892,165 ops/sec ±1.28% (93 runs sampled)\nBuffer#copy x 11,208,889 ops/sec ±0.76% (91 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#copy\n\nNewBuffer#readDoubleBE x 1,057,233 ops/sec ±1.28% (88 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#readDoubleBE x 4,094 ops/sec ±1.09% (86 runs sampled)\nBuffer#readDoubleBE x 1,587,308 ops/sec ±0.87% (84 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#readDoubleBE\n\nNewBuffer#new x 739,791 ops/sec ±0.89% (89 runs sampled)\nUint8Array#new x 2,745,243 ops/sec ±0.95% (91 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#new x 2,604,537 ops/sec ±0.93% (88 runs sampled)\nBuffer#new x 1,836,218 ops/sec ±0.74% (92 runs sampled)\nFastest is Uint8Array#new\n\nNewBuffer#readFloatBE x 1,111,263 ops/sec ±0.41% (97 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#readFloatBE x 4,026 ops/sec ±1.24% (90 runs sampled)\nBuffer#readFloatBE x 1,611,800 ops/sec ±0.58% (96 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#readFloatBE\n\nNewBuffer#readUInt32LE x 502,024 ops/sec ±0.59% (94 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#readUInt32LE x 1,259,028 ops/sec ±0.79% (87 runs sampled)\nBuffer#readUInt32LE x 2,778,635 ops/sec ±0.46% (97 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#readUInt32LE\n\nNewBuffer#slice x 1,174,908 ops/sec ±1.47% (89 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#slice x 2,396,302 ops/sec ±4.36% (86 runs sampled)\nBuffer#slice x 2,994,029 ops/sec ±0.79% (89 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#slice\n\nNewBuffer#writeFloatBE x 721,081 ops/sec ±1.10% (86 runs sampled)\nOldBuffer#writeFloatBE x 4,020 ops/sec ±1.04% (92 runs sampled)\nBuffer#writeFloatBE x 1,811,134 ops/sec ±0.67% (91 runs sampled)\nFastest is Buffer#writeFloatBE\n```\n\n\n## credit\n\nThis was originally forked from [buffer-browserify](https://github.com/toots/buffer-browserify).\n\n\n## license\n\nMIT.
